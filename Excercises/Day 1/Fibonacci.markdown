**Assignment: Fibonacci Series in C#**

**Instructions:**

Write a C# program to generate the Fibonacci series up to a specified
number of terms. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where
each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with
0 and 1.

**Requirements:**

1.  Create a new Project called **Fibonacci Series** (Console
    Application) in a new Solution called Assignments.

2.  In the Program.cs implement a function and invoke it in the Main
    method.

3.  Prompt the user to enter the number of terms they want in the
    Fibonacci series.

4.  Validate the input to ensure it is a positive integer.

5.  Generate and display the Fibonacci series up to the specified number
    of terms.

**Example Output:**

**Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci series: 10**

**Fibonacci series up to 10 terms: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34**
